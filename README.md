## Javascript Calculator

A simple responsive calculator written in vanilla Javascript.
It can be viewed here: https://branderso87.github.io/calculator/

## Triumphs:

The front end was easy to assemble using the mockup provided and a bit of flexbox.

## Problems:

This was my first attempt to do a project completely in Javascript. Functionally, it turned out ok but I had issues with:
  * Event handlers on each of the keys
  * How to convert concatenated numbers and strings to an operation
  * Handling multiple number entries
  * Error handling (mostly because THERE IS NO ERROR HANDLING)
  * Testing

## Install

 * Clone this repo
 * Open index.html in your browser
